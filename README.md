## Checklist of Principles

 - Show Comparisons
     + relative hypotheses
     + compared to what?
 - Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
     + What's the causal framework for thinking about a question?
 - Show multivariate data
 - Integrate evidence
     + Make use of many modes of data presentation
 - Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels
 - Content is king

## Instructions

1. Please fork this repo: https://github.com/jbwhit/2017-05-PyCon-EDA-Tutorial
2. Do an Exploratory Data Analysis (without working with others) on the dataset contained (see the Notebook and data already in the repo).
3. Keeping in mind the research question: Are soccer referees more likely to give red cards to dark skin toned players than light skin toned players?
4. Submit a Pull-Request and I will recombine everyone's efforts and insights.

The dataset is a single csv, and there is an included data dictionary. There are links to more information about the dataset available.

The reason for using this dataset is that this dataset (and research question) was at the heart of the fantastic paper: [Many analysts, one dataset: Making transparent how variations in analytical choices affect results](https://osf.io/gvm2z/) which showed how 30 different data science teams used the same dataset to answer the same research question to arrive at 30 different answers.
